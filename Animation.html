            <p style="background-color: #ffe6ff;font-weight: bold;" >In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine.Whether you relish snails in garlic sauce or not, French cuisine is undeniably iconic. From the simple crunchy baguette to the rich sauces, creamy gratins, and luscious pastries.Similar to other cuisines, French gastronomy didn’t evolve in isolation. It drew inspiration from many of its neighbors, which led to the creation of a vast menu of regional dishes and variations influenced by Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium. The French word for breakfast is le petit-déjeuner, which literally means “small lunch,” with emphasis on the “small.” This is because French people tend to skip breakfast and have a cup of black coffee, tea, or café au lait (coffee with milk).Le déjeuner, which – you guessed it – means lunch in French, is typically a several-course affair. This is usually the heartiest meal of the day and is typically eaten between 11:30 and 14:00. What French people eat for dinner (le dîner in French) depends on how much they indulged at lunch. They usually keep it simple and have it around 19:30 or 20:00. </p>
